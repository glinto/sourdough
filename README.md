# sourdough

A basic calculator for sourdough bread makers. I created it to keep my waste minimum, prepare just the right amount of starter and tell how much motherdough I need to refresh weekly.

## How to use

- Use the nav menu to select your preferred method. 'Easy / fast proof' is less stiky, thus easier to handle, 'Normal' offers deeper flavor. These are my favorite proportions, you can alter them to your liking in the *recipes* array
- You can also select language in the nav menu. Language contributions are welcome :)

## Installation

Nothing fancy, just checkout anywhere and run index.html. I intentionally kept it monolith with all JS and CSS embedded for best portability. Alternatively, you can use it directly on GitHub Pages: [https://glinto.github.io/sourdough/](https://glinto.github.io/sourdough/)
